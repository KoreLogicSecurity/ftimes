1 Overview

  HashDig technology is a collection of utilities designed to help
  practitioners automate the process of resolving hashes.  In the
  early stages of an investigation, it is not typically possible or
  practical to examine all subject files.  Therefore, practitioners
  need reliable methods that can quickly reduce the number of files
  requiring examination.  One such method is to group files into two
  general categories: known and unknown.  This method can be
  implemented quite effectively by manipulating hashes and comparing
  them to one or more reference databases.  Even that, however, can
  take a significant amount of effort.  HashDig technology attempts to
  reduce this burden through automation and the use of lightweight,
  open, and verifiable techniques.

  HashDig technology was designed to work in conjunction with FTimes
  and is currently maintained and distributed under that project.
  The name, HashDig, is reminiscent of the dig (domain information
  groper) utility because it performs a type of resolution.

  FTimes is a system baselining and evidence collection tool.  The
  primary purpose of FTimes is to gather and/or develop topographical
  information and attributes about specified directories and files in
  a manner conducive to intrusion and forensic analysis.  FTimes is
  available at:

2 Constructing Reference Databases

  There are a number of different sources for obtaining known hashes.
  The purpose of this section is to describe how to harvest these
  sources and create reference databases using HashDig technology.
  Any database that contains known hashes can be used as a reference.
  However, it's best to construct reference databases such that
  they only contain known hashes.

  A HashDig database is an ordered list of MD5, SHA1, or SHA256 hashes
  -- each of which is tagged as known (K) or unknown (U).  HashDig
  databases are implemented as BTrees and constructed using Perl's
  DB_File module.  Enumerating these databases yields the following
  format:

    hash|category

  Ideally, reference databases should be proactively created and
  regularly maintained.  The payoff for this investment is realized
  when you are called upon to investigate an intrusion or verify
  the integrity of various files.

  The most important investment you can make to speed hash resolution
  is to create system baselines for all systems under your purview.
  Ideally, this would be done before each system is deployed in an
  operational environment.  If these systems undergo a significant
  amount of change, then it is equally important to take snapshots
  on a regular basis.  With tools like FTimes that were built to
  operate on an enterprise scale, the cost of setting up an integrity
  monitoring framework pales in comparison to the amount of time
  it will take to resolve hashes where no prior baselines exist.

  That being said, the remainder of this section is dedicated to
  the task of creating reference databases from the various available
  sources.  Important sources for hash resolution include:

    - National Software Reference Library (NSRL)
    - Sun's Solaris Fingerprint Database
    - HashKeeper
    - KnownGoods
    - Installation media, packages, and backups

  Two critical assumptions, implicit in this approach, are that
  these sources are untainted and their hashes correspond to known
  good files.  It is possible that a particular source contains
  hashes that correspond to known bad files, but that would require
  additional tags or separate handling to prevent confusion.  This
  document makes the assumption that all hashes harvested from
  reference sources correspond to known good files.

2.1 National Software Reference Library (NSRL)

  Information on the NSRL project and how to obtain NSRL data sets
  is available here:

    http://www.nsrl.nist.gov/index.html

  Over time, NSRL data sets will play an increasingly important
  role in hash resolution -- to the point that best practices will
  dictate their involvement in all but the most trivial cases.

  To construct an MD5 reference database from NSRL data sets, run the
  following commands:

    hashdig-harvest.pl -c k -t nsrl1 -o nsrl.hd NSRLFile.txt

    hashdig-make.pl -F -i -d nsrl.db nsrl.hd

  Documentation on hashdig-harvest.pl and hashdig-make.pl can be
  obtained by running perldoc on the respective files as follows:

    perldoc hashdig-harvest.pl

    perldoc hashdig-make.pl

  As additional NSRL data sets are released, any new MD5 hashes can be
  merged into the existing database (i.e., nsrl.db) by rerunning the
  harvest and make utilities as follows:

    hashdig-harvest.pl -c k -t nsrl1 -o nsrl.hd.new NSRLFile.txt.new

    hashdig-make.pl -d nsrl.db nsrl.hd.new

2.1.1 NSRL Gotchas

  Presently, hashdig-make.pl properly parses NSRL data sets, but
  there is one known issue to keep in mind: The field separator for
  NSRL data sets is a comma.  The problem with this is that various
  filenames in the data sets (e.g., ",jack.gif") also contain commas.
  Unfortunately, this complicates parsing logic and makes it more
  error prone.  If you are processing NSRL data and observe errors
  related to record parsing, inspect the offending record(s) to
  determine if this issue applies.

  Running the harvest script on millions of hashes takes a lot of
  space.  Consequently, your /tmp partition may fill up.  By default,
  /tmp is used as the temporary work area.  This location can be
  changed with the '-T' option.

  Don't assume that all hashes in NSRL data sets are known good
  hashes.

2.2 Sun's Solaris Fingerprint Database

  Sun's online fingerprint database is available here:

    http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/fileFingerprints.pl

  To create an MD5 Sun reference database, you must first acquire some
  hashes -- Sun's online interface does not allow you to request
  hashes by filename.

  One approach to this problem would be to baseline your Solaris
  systems and resolve the collected hashes against Sun's online
  database.  Assuming the systems were baselined with FTimes and
  the corresponding map files are located in ${MAPS}, then the
  following set of commands can be used to construct an MD5 reference
  database:

    hashdig-harvest.pl -c u -t ftimes -o snapshot.hd ${MAPS}/*.map

    hashdig-make.pl -F -i -d snapshot.db snapshot.hd

    hashdig-dump.pl -c u -h snapshot.db | hashdig-resolve-sunsolve.pl -f -

    hashdig-harvest-sunsolve.pl -c k -o sunsolve.hd sunsolve

    hashdig-make.pl -F -i -d sunsolve.db sunsolve.hd

  Documentation on these utilities can be obtained by running perldoc
  on the respective files.

  Each time you sling new hashes against Sun's online database, you
  should take time to merge any resolved MD5 hashes into your existing
  reference database (i.e., sunsolve.db).  Assuming the newly resolved
  hashes are in sunsolve.hd.new, this can be done as follows:

    hashdig-make.pl -d sunsolve.db sunsolve.hd.new

  As a side note, slinging hashes collected from other OSes against
  Sun's online database can yield useful results.

2.3 HashKeeper

  To create an MD5 HashKeeper reference database, you must first
  download some hash sets, which may be difficult to do these days.
  Assuming the hash sets you downloaded are located in ${HKS}, then
  the following commands can be used to construct a reference
  database:

    hashdig-harvest.pl -c k -t hk -o hk.hd ${HKS}/*.hsh

    hashdig-make.pl -F -i -d hk.db hk.hd

  As additional hash sets are released, any new MD5 hashes can be
  merged into the existing database (i.e., hk.db) by rerunning the
  harvest and make utilities as follows:

    hashdig-harvest.pl -c k -t hk -o hk.hd.new ${HKS}/*.hsh.new

    hashdig-make.pl -d hk.db hk.hd.new

2.3.1 HashKeeper Gotchas

  See NSRL Gotchas.

2.4 KnownGoods

  KnownGoods hash sets are available here:

    http://www.knowngoods.org/download.html

  To create an MD5 KnownGoods reference database, you must first
  download some hash sets.  Assuming the hash sets you downloaded are
  located in ${KGS}, then the following commands can be used to
  construct a reference database:

    hashdig-harvest.pl -c k -t kg -o kg.hd ${KGS}/*.txt

    hashdig-make.pl -F -i -d kg.db kg.hd

  As additional hash sets are released, any new MD5 hashes can be
  merged into the existing database (i.e., kg.db) by rerunning the
  harvest and make utilities as follows:

    hashdig-harvest.pl -c k -t kg -o kg.hd.new ${KGS}/*.txt.new

    hashdig-make.pl -d kg.db kg.hd.new

2.4.1 KnownGoods Gotchas

  See NSRL Gotchas.

2.5 Installation Media, Packages, and Backups

  Installation media, packages, and backups, if trusted and untainted,
  can play a major role in hash resolution.  This is because they
  are more likely to contain files that actually exist on subject
  systems.

  The standard approach for building a reference database from
  installation media or packages would be to install them on a clean
  system, baseline the installed files with FTimes, and run the
  HashDig make utility on the resulting map data.  In some cases,
  it may not be necessary to install the media/package.  For example,
  if the media/package was distributed as a tar ball or zip file,
  then simply unpacking it in a clean directory would suffice for
  the first step.

  With backups, the basic process is the same except that backups
  need only to be restored in a clean directory.  With backups,
  however, one must be confident that the attackers have not become
  entrenched in the backup process.

  Assuming the maps you collected for installation media, packages,
  and backups are located in ${MAPS}, then the following commands
  can be used to construct an MD5 reference database:

    hashdig-harvest.pl -c k -t ftimes -o site.hd ${MAPS}/*.map

    hashdig-make.pl -F -i -d site.db site.hd

3 Hash Resolution Work-Flow

  At a high level, the hash resolution work-flow roughly consists
  of the following steps:

    - Harvesting Subject Hashes
    - Subject Database Construction
    - Subject Database Bashing
    - Binding Subject Hashes Back to Filenames
    - Sorting and Filtering

  The following sub-sections discuss these steps in more detail.

3.1 Harvesting Subject Hashes

  The hash resolution work-flow begins by harvesting all unique,
  subject hashes relevant to your investigation and tagging them
  as unknown.  Typically, these hashes would come from FTimes map
  data, but they could also come from a number of other sources
  such as md5, md5deep, md5sum, and so on.  Assuming that your map
  files are located in ${MAPS}, then the following command would
  be used to harvest the subject hashes:

    hashdig-harvest.pl -c u -t ftimes -o subject.hd ${MAPS}/*.map

  Note: If you are processing SHA1 or SHA256 hashes, you'll either
  need to set the HASH_TYPE environment variable or use the '-a'
  command line argument.  See the man page for details.

3.2 Subject Database Construction

  Once hashes have been harvested, the subject database can be
  constructed.  This would be done with the following command:

    hashdig-make.pl -F -i -d subject.db subject.hd

  Note: If you are processing SHA1 or SHA256 hashes, you'll either
  need to set the HASH_TYPE environment variable or use the '-a'
  command line argument.  See the man page for details.

  Keep a backup of this database for future reference as subsequent
  steps will alter its contents.

    cp subject.db subject.db.orig

3.3 Subject Database Bashing

  Next, subject hashes are bashed against (compared to) existing
  reference databases (e.g., nsrl.db, sunsolve.db, hk.db, kg.db,
  site.db, etc.) -- these are databases that you create and maintain.
  As hashes in the subject database are resolved, their category
  information is updated.  The primary rule of engagement is that
  known hashes trump unknown hashes.  In shell speak this process
  takes on the following form:

    for i in "nsrl.db" "sunsolve.db" "hk.db" "kg.db" "site.db" ; do
      hashdig-bash.pl -r $i -s subject.db
    done

3.3.1 Harvesting Online Resources

  At this point, all existing reference sets have been exhausted.
  If necessary and appropriate, any remaining unknown hashes should
  be submitted to Sun's online fingerprint database for resolution.
  The HashDig way to do this is as follows:

    hashdig-dump.pl -c u -h subject.db | hashdig-resolve-sunsolve.pl -f -

  Hashes resolved by Sun should be harvested and placed in a temporary
  reference database.

    hashdig-harvest-sunsolve.pl -c k -o sunsolve.tmp.hd sunsolve

    hashdig-make.pl -F -i -d sunsolve.tmp.db sunsolve.tmp.hd

  Then, subject hashes are bashed again.

    hashdig-bash.pl -r sunsolve.tmp.db -s subject.db

  After the bashing is complete, the temporary HashDig file should
  be merged into your existing reference database.

    hashdig-make.pl -d sunsolve.db sunsolve.tmp.hd

3.4 Binding Subject Hashes Back to Filenames

  When all reference databases have been exhausted, hashes in the
  subject database are rebound to the map files from whence they
  came.

    hashdig-dump.pl subject.db | hashdig-bind.pl -t ftimes -f - ${MAPS}/*.map

  Note: If you are processing SHA1 or SHA256 hashes, you'll either
  need to set the HASH_TYPE environment variable or use the '-a'
  command line argument.  See the man page for details.

3.5 Sorting and Filtering

  As a followup step, the practitioner may decide that it's necessary
  or desirable to sort or filter the output in different ways.  One
  approach for narrowing the list of unknowns is to filter the data
  according to directory type (i.e., bin, dev, etc, lib, and man).

    hashdig-filter.pl *.bound.u

4 Supported File Formats

  Currently, hashdig-harvest.pl supports the following formats:
  FTIMES, FTK, HK|HASHKEEPER, KG|KNOWNGOODS, MD5, MD5DEEP, MD5SUM,
  OPENSSL, NSRL1, NSRL2, PLAIN, RPM, SHA1, SHA1DEEP, SHA1SUM, SHA256,
  SHA256DEEP, and SHA256SUM.  Of these, hashdig-bind.pl supports the
  following formats: FTIMES, FTK, KG|KNOWNGOODS, MD5, MD5DEEP, MD5SUM,
  OPENSSL, SHA1, SHA1DEEP, SHA1SUM, SHA256, SHA256DEEP, and SHA256SUM.
  The only format supported by hashdig-make.pl is HASHDIG.

  Details regarding each supported format are discussed in the
  following sections.

4.1 FTimes

  Any FTimes map data that contains, at a minimum, the name and md5
  fields is supported.  However, when processing map data collected
  from UNIX systems, it is helpful to include the mode field as it
  is used to filter out symlink hashes -- generally, symlink hashes
  are not used during hash resolution.

  Here's an example invocation (--mapauto mode):

    ftimes --mapauto all-magic /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin

  Here's the minimum FTimes format (i.e., FieldMask=none+md5):

    name|md5

  Here's the typical UNIX format (i.e., FieldMask=all-magic):

    name|dev|inode|mode|nlink|uid|gid|rdev|atime|mtime|ctime|size|md5|sha1|sha256

  Here's the typical WIN32 format (i.e., FieldMask=all-magic):

    name|volume|findex|attributes|atime|ams|mtime|mms|ctime|cms|chtime|chms|size|altstreams|md5|sha1|sha256

  Note that filenames in FTimes output are and URL encoded.  Therefore,
  it may be necessary to insert a URL decoding stage at the appropriate
  point in your work-flow.  The following code snippet is a Perl
  subroutine that does this type of decoding:

  sub URLDecode
  {
    my ($rawString) = @_;
    $rawString =~ s/\+/ /sg;
    $rawString =~ s/%([0-9a-fA-F]{2})/pack('C', hex($1))/seg;
    return $rawString;
  }

5 Requirements

  For the various HashDig scripts to work properly, Perl, sort, and
  the following Perl modules: DB_File, File::Basename, FileHandle,
  Getopt::Std, and IO::Socket must exist on the target system.
  However, not all modules are required for each script, and sort
  is only required for the harvest scripts.

  Any system that runs hashdig-resolve-sunsolve.pl must be able to
  make HTTP connections to Sun's Solaris Fingerprint Database.

  Creating HashDig databases and binding hashes can quickly exhaust
  all available memory.  As a general rule, assume that each block
  of 1 million hashes consumes roughly 32 MB of RAM.

  HashDig scripts were designed to run in UNIX environments.  Using
  them in other environments is not supported at this time.

6 License

  All HashDig documentation and code is distributed under same terms
  and conditions as FTimes.
