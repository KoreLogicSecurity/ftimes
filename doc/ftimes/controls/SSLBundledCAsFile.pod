=item B<SSLBundledCAsFile>: <file>

Applies to B<digfull>, B<mapfull>, and B<getmode>.

B<SSLBundledCAsFile> is required when B<SSLVerifyPeerCert> is
enabled.  This control specifies the name of a PEM (Privacy Enhanced
Mail) encoded file that contains a bundled set of Certificate
Authority (CA) certificates.  Any validated peer certificate that
is signed by one of these certificate authorities will be accepted
provided that the B<SSLMaxChainLength> and B<SSLExpectedPeerCN>
checks are also satisfied.  B<SSLBundledCAsFile> may be specified
as a relative path.
