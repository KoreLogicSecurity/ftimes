=item B<IncludesMustExist>: [Y|N]

Applies to B<digfull>, B<diglean>, B<mapfull>, and B<maplean>.

B<IncludesMustExist> is optional.  When enabled ('Y' or 'y'), it
instructs B<FTimes> to check that every B<Include> exists prior to
mapping or digging.  If this control is enabled and any B<Include>
does not exist, B<FTimes> will abort.  The default value is 'N'.
