=item B<AnalyzeDeviceFiles>: [Y|N]

Applies to B<digfull>, B<diglean>, B<mapfull>, and B<maplean>.

B<AnalyzeDeviceFiles> is optional.  When enabled ('Y' or 'y'), it
instructs B<FTimes> to analyze block/character device files that
have been specifically included by name on the command line or
through an B<Include> (e.g., Include=/dev/ad0).  Device files that
reside in an included directory (e.g., Include=/dev) are not analyzed
simply because their parent was included -- you must specifically
call them out.  Also, any device files that were specifically
included will be pruned if their parent or any higher level directory
was included too.  The default value is 'N'.

Note: Analyzing block/character device files can take a very long
time or forever (e.g., /dev/zero).
