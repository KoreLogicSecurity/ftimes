=item B<Include>: [directory|file|link]

Applies to B<digfull>, B<diglean>, B<mapfull>, and B<maplean>.

B<Include> controls are optional, and there is no predefined limit
on the number that may be specified.  However, there can be only
one B<Include> control/value pair per line.  If no B<Include>
controls are specified, B<FTimes> will attempt to map the entire
system.  If B<IncludesMustExist> is enabled, then each B<Include>
must reference an existing file, directory, or symbolic link.
Otherwise, B<FTimes> will abort.

B<Include> values must be a regular file, directory, or symbolic
link specified as a fully qualified path.  For WIN32 file systems,
this means that each B<Include> must begin with a drive designator
([A-Za-z]:) and be followed by the target path (e.g., 'c:\temp').
For UNIX file systems, each B<Include> must begin with a forward
slash (e.g., '/tmp').

Note: Symbolic links are not supported in WIN32-based file systems.

Note: Take care when including file systems that reside on remote
shares because B<FTimes> may attempt to map them.  To prevent this
from happening, you can either exclude the remote file system or
disable B<AnalyzeRemoteFiles>.

Note: Directory hashing only applies to directories.  This means
that each file B<Include> is treated as an isolated object apart
from any specific tree.  The exception to this is any B<Include>
that gets automatically pruned because it's part of a larger branch.
