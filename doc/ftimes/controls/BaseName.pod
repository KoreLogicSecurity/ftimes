=item B<BaseName>: <name|->

Applies to B<digfull>, B<diglean>, B<getmode>, B<mapfull>, and
B<maplean>.

B<BaseName> is required.  It specifies the name prefix that will
be attached to the various output files.  It also serves as the
CLIENTID parameter in GET/PING/PUT requests.  The recommended name
format is one that matches the following regular expression:

    ^[0-9A-Za-z_-]{1,64}$

This is because nph-ftimes.cgi uses that expression to validate the
CLIENTID parameter in GET/PING/PUT requests.  Typically, B<BaseName>
and B<URLUsername> will be the same when basic authentication is
enabled, but this is not a requirement.

If you're using FTimes in a lean mode, a good naming convention
would be to use the hostname of the system being baselined.  Also,
both lean modes allow you to specify a B<BaseName> value of '-'.
This causes FTimes to write its output to stdout/stderr.
