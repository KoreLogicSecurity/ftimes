=item B<DigStringNormal>: <string> [<tag>]

Applies to B<digauto>, B<digfull>, and B<diglean>.

B<DigStringNormal> is conditionally required.  It specifies a search
string.  This string must be URL encoded if it contains '%', '+',
' ', or any non-printable characters.  When in doubt about whether
or not a value should be encoded, encode it.  To encode a character,
convert its hex value according to the format %HH where H is a hex
digit.  Spaces may alternatively be encoded as '+'.

An optional tag may specified.  Tags can be used to identify a given
dig string or set of strings -- the same tag may be assigned to
multiple strings.  This can make the process of analyzing dig output
much easier.  However, tags must not contain embedded white space, and
they must be less than 64 bytes long.
