=item B<URLGetURL>: <url>

Applies to B<getmode>.

B<URLGetURL> is required.  It defines the scheme, user credentials,
host address, port, and CGI application to be used when making
requests.  If a username/password pair is specified in the URL,
that pair takes precedence over the values specified by
B<URLUsername>/B<URLPassword>, if any.  URLs must use a scheme of
http or https and satisfy the following regular expression:

scheme://(user(:pass)?@)?host(:port)?/(path(\?query)?)?
