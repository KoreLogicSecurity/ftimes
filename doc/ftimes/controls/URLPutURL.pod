=item B<URLPutURL>: <url>

Applies to B<digfull> and B<mapfull>.

B<URLPutURL> is optional.  It defines the scheme, user credentials,
host address, port, and CGI application to be used when making PUT
requests.  If a username/password pair is specified in the URL,
that pair takes precedence over the values specified by
B<URLUsername>/B<URLPassword>, if any.  In any event, user credentials
are only sent when basic authentication has been requested (See
B<URLAuthType>).  B<URLPutURL> uses the same syntax as B<URLGetURL>.
