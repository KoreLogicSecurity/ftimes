=item B<AnalyzeRemoteFiles>: [Y|N]

Applies to B<digfull>, B<diglean>, B<mapfull>, and B<maplean>.

B<AnalyzeRemoteFiles> is optional.  When enabled ('Y' or 'y'), it
instructs B<FTimes> to ignore the fact that a given B<Include> does
not reside on the local system.  The result is that B<FTimes> will
attempt to analyze remote files.  The default value is 'N'.

Note: Analyzing remote file systems can create large amounts of
network traffic.  Just remember that you may be mapping an entire
disk.
