=item B<FieldMask>: <mask>

Applies to B<compare>, B<mapauto>, B<mapfull>, and B<maplean>.

B<FieldMask> is required in B<compare>.  Its value indicates what
fields are to be compared for change.

B<FieldMask> is required in B<mapauto>, B<mapfull>, and B<maplean>.
Its value dictates what attributes get collected or derived during
a scan.

There can be no embedded white space in a given mask specification,
and it must comply with the following case insensitive syntax:

    ALL[<+|-><field>...]

or

    NONE<+|-><field>[<+|-><field>...]

The following fields may be specified on Windows platforms with two
caveats:  (1) chtime is only available on Windows NT/2K systems and
(2) altstreams is only available if the target file system is NTFS.

    volume     - Volume serial number
    findex     - File serial number
    attributes - File attributes
    atime      - Time of last file access
    mtime      - Time of last file modification
    ctime      - Creation time
    chtime     - Change time (undocumented)
    size       - File size in bytes
    altstreams - Number of alternate or named streams
    md5        - MD5 digest of the file's data stream
    sha1       - SHA1 digest of the file's data stream
    sha256     - SHA256 digest of the file's data stream
    magic      - File type

The following fields may be specified on UNIX platforms:

    dev        - Device identification number
    inode      - File identification number
    mode       - File attributes and permissions
    nlink      - Number of hard links
    uid        - User identification number
    gid        - Group identification number
    rdev       - Device type (contains major/minor numbers)
    atime      - Time of last file access
    mtime      - Time of last file modification
    ctime      - Time of last file status change
    size       - File size in bytes
    md5        - MD5 digest of the file's data stream
    sha1       - SHA1 digest of the file's data stream
    sha256     - SHA256 digest of the file's data stream
    magic      - File type

In addition to the standard fields, the following group fields may be
specified:

    hashes     - Compute all supported hash values
    times      - Collect all supported time values

For example, the "hashes field is equivalent to "md5+sha1+sha256".
Similarly, the "times" field is equivalent to "atime+mtime+ctime" and
"atime+mtime+ctime+chtime" on UNIX and Windows platforms,
respectively.
